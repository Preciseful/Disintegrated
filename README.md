# Disintegrated
A discord bot made in Discord.NET.

## Commands
`Ping` -> Get the discord's bot latency.

## What's the use of this bot?
There's no practical use of this other than to maybe serve as a template for people who use Discord.NET. I made it just for the fun of making a simple template bot!

## How do I use this?
It's simple.
* Build the project.
* Create a `config.json` file. The path of the file does not matter.
* Run the program with the first argument being the path to the `config.json` file you just made.
* Yay!

## What should the config.json file look like?
```
{
 "Token": "Bot Token Here"
}
```
